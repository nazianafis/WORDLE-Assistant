# WORDLE-Assistant
Wordle is a popular daily word game that can be played online [here](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). 

It gives players six chances to guess a randomly selected five-letter word. As seen in the image, if you have a letter in its correct spot, it shows up green. A correct letter in the wrong spot shows up yellow. A letter that isn't in the word in any spot shows up gray.

If you've got only a couple of attempts in the game left and a bunch of yellow/green (inclusion) and grey (exclusions) letters, you can make use of [this](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nn007/WORDLE-Assistant) simple application to have a look at all words that are possible with the combination of your inclusion and exclusion letters.
